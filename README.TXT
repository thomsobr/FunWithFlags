PROJECT TITLE: FunWithFlags
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
To draw any horizontal or vertical three stripe flag.

****** NOTE ******
For some reason the 91906 section in the OneNote has not been able to load on my laptop for the last day or so
(other class OneNotes have been working fine so it's not internet).
This meant I couldn't look at the actual assignment and did it based off of my memory of
the assignment (create a program that can draw any 3 stripe flag).
So apologies if I was supposed to make the program differently than I did!
Also means I was not able to see what the extension work was.

VERSION or DATE: 23/04/20
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Run the main ofGeneralFlags (France class was made as an initial test of
how the program might work). Press okay on the first pop up box without entering anything
into the pop up box.

AUTHORS: Brook Thomson

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

Have the RGB numbers for the colours you want ready in advance, as well as the ratio of 
the flag. (if ratio unknown, I recommend 2:3). Enter each number individually as the 
program asks. The ratio numbers have to be entered seperately, and no ":" should be with
them.
When asked if the flag has horizontal or vertical stripes, if wanting horizontal stripes, you must spell it out
in full, not just "h".
